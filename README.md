This repo provides the solutions to the Applied exercises after every chapter in the first edition of the book ["Introduction to Statistical Learning"](https://www.statlearning.com/) by Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Gareth M. James, Robert Tibshirani. The code and explanations are presented in the form of an R notebook as well as a HTML file.
